== KNOCKBACK ==
- Actors can use certain effects in order to apply knockback.
- Being knocked back into a wall results in losing one or more turns.
    - Positioning becomes very important.
- POSSIBLE ADDITION: When one actor collides with another, the stationary
  actor gains an immediate bonus turn.

== CHAIN TURN === 
- Inspired by the Shin Megami Tensei series Press Turn system.
- An attack that deals damage of a type that an enemy is weak against costs
  half as much energy.
  - Allows for great flexibility in terms of how one approaches battles, and
    prompts thought about character builds.
- An attack that deals damage of a type that an enemy resists costs twice
  as much energy.
  - Forces careful thought and improvisation during battles in order to avoid
    getting combo'd. You cannot simply spam the same attacks over and over
    again.
- Potential Flaw: Degenerate strategies, such as hitting an enemy's weakness,
  then immediately backing up, forcing them to approach again.
    - This is potentially limited by space, and the aforementioned danger of
      being backed up against walls.
    - Potentially mitigated by cost of repeated spell use.
- Potential Flaw: Penalizes new players, since they may be unfamiliar with
  enemy resists. Veteran players will be essentially playing a different
  game than new players.
    - Potential Solution: Slightly randomize enemy resists on every run. Would
      create flavor issues, unfortunately.
    - Potential Solution: Give players access to all information about every
      enemy. Would destroy mood and discovery aspects.
    - Potential Solution: No solution. Give most enemies a static set of weaknesses
      and resistances.
- Potential Flaw: May encourage players to go as wide as possible, rather than
  going deep. Why make extremely powerful spells of certain elements if you can
  cover every single one?
    - Potential solution: Allow players to go wide on some level, but going wide requires
      sacrificing other options.
    - Potential solution: Using a spell of a certain element will make you weak to that
      element for a number of turns. Thus, spamming spells of many different elements
      results in increased risk. ****
    - Potential solution: Consumables that allow for dealing elemental damage.
- Potential Flaw: May encourage hoarding.
    - Potential Solution: Non-persistent levels.

== LIGHT AND SOUND ==
- Enemies react to light and sound using dijkstra maps.
- Certain attacks can manipulate light and sound.

== GRABS ==
- You can initiate a grab at the cost of 100 energy.
- Grabbing a creature will set its momentum to zero.
- While grabbing an enemy, all of their attacks automatically hit you.
- You can throw an enemy who is below a certain weight threshold.
