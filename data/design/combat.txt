Things we want out of the combat system:
- Wide array of effects other than just damage.
- Allows for a variety of builds and player expression.
- Simple enough that it is not a barrier to entry, but
  complex enough that is dynamic.

Things we do NOT want in our system:
- Combat should not be the best solution to every given
  problem.
- Combat should not boil down to simply pressing the
  direction of an enemy over and over again.
- Combat should not be a copy of the d20 system. That
  system is overdone.


== SYSTEM ONE: FIGHTING GAME ==
- Two HP bars: Health and Recoverable Health.
- Damage can be applied to health or recoverable health.
- Recoverable health regenerates over time.
- If health is greater than recoverable health, it falls
  over time until the two are equal.

Pros:
- Easy to implement. Required stats are as follows:
    - Health
    - Recoverable Health
- Relatively easy to understand.
- Allows for potentially interesting situations, such
  as enemies that only attack non-recoverable health.
- Could combine nicely with the medkit system: Player can
  expend a medkit in order to recover their recoverable
  health.
- More forgiving than a total lack of healing.
- Allows for combat with large swings that is still
  relatively forgiving.
- Different builds could alter meter mechanics in different
  ways.
- Allows for HP-to-One attacks.

Cons:
- Still encourages waiting around for one's health to
  refill.
- Damage to health might feel bad for players, and
  encourage them to quit playing.
- Fighting or exploring at very low health might be
  difficult.
- Could lead to fighting feeling very "tanky." Perhaps
  a small amount of damage could always be applied to
  health?

Potential Mitigations:
- Health can be increased, but only by descending to a
  depth that has not yet been visited.
  - Descending to an unvisited depth increases recoverable
    health to the maximum, and regular health increases by
    a decent amount as well.
- Allow recoverable health to increase above regular health.
  It could act similar to barrier points from Arcturus.

== SYSTEM TWO: NO HEALTH REGEN ==
- Straight hit points with no health regeneration.

Pros:
- Avoids the need for a clock, because health itself becomes
  the clock.
- The more you want to grind, the harder the game becomes.
  Simultaneously, moving too quickly will also result in a
  loss, since you will miss out on good items.
- Combat is quick, as opposed to grindy.
- Combat is greatly simplified.

Cons:
- Getting hit in any way has a permanent impact.
- May lead to exceedingly careful gameplay.
- Will potentially trigger the OCD of players like me.
- Incredibly unforgiving.
- New players may attempt to descend too deep too quickly and
  die because of it.
- Combat is, by nature, very quick.
- Combat is greatly simplified.

Potential Mitigations:
- Restore health when descending to a level that has not been
  visited before.


== SYSTEM THREE: NO *NATURAL* HEALTH REGEN ==
- Straight hit points with no natural health regen.
- Many ways to restore hit points the normal way.
- HP is fully restored upon entering an area that has not been visited.


== SYSTEM FOUR: CRAZINESS ==
- Straight hit points with no natural health regen.
- Armor changes your dodge rate and your hit points:
  - Dodge rate is just percentage-based chance to dodge, and modifies enemies to-hit percentages.
  - Armor hit points are the hit points of the object.
    - When you put on a piece of armor, its hit points are added to your own.
    - Armor hit points are lost before any other kind of hit points.
- Armor points are restored when descending to a level that you have not visited before.
- Hit points do not regenerate except via direct intervention, or by entering an entirely
  new area. 

This allows for interesting situations:
- Wearing your weapon on your back as a last ditch attempt to gain a few extra hit points.
- HP-to-1 attacks are perfectly viable, and slightly less unfair than they would otherwise be.
- Swapping to a newer piece of armor in order to better protect yourself. 
- Taking off a broken piece of armor that penalizes your chance to dodge.
