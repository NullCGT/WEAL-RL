== Scoring ==
- We will include scoring simply because players love high score lists.
- Scoring 


== Score Calculation ==
+++ Maximum Depth
    - We want to reward maximum depth above nearly all else.
++  Identifeid Items
    - Figuring out the game's secrets should be rewarded.
++  Descent to New Levels when "In Danger"
    - We want to reward "risky" play, so descending to a new level while
      in danger should always result in a reward.
+ Kills
    - Defeating a monster should result in an experience rewards.
    - Defeating a monster while "in danger" should result in a larger experience
      reward, because again, we want to reward risky behavior.
    - Defeating the same type of monster repeatedly results in lower xp rewards.
- Killing innocents / peacefuls
    - Killing an innocent should penalize one's score a small amount, because we
      do not want to reward that behavior.
    - The penalty should not be overly large, otherwise we risk creating a
      perverse incentive.
    - New idea: What if we cut the player's score *in half* when they kill
      an innocent? That way, it simply brings thier score closer to zero, rather
      than raising or lowering their score.
- Turns
    - Every turn taken drops the player's score by a few points. This should help
      reduce boring play during score maxouts.
- Hitting an opponent's resistance.
    - Hitting an opponent's resistance drops one's score by a small amount.
+ Hitting an opponent's weakness.
    - Hitting an opponent's weakness improves one's score by a small amount.
+ Using a consumable item.
    - We want players to be unafraid of using consumables, and (as usual) we want
      to encourage risky play. Thus, using consumables should result in a small number
      of points.

== Ideas ==
- Add a taunt button.
    - When the player taunts, they are temporarily weak to everything, and lose a few
      turns.
    - Geting hit while taunting increases one's points.
- Add a friendly little dude that appears to say hi to the player when they reach one
  million points, or some sort of other arbitrary milestone. Reward exploring the
  game! :D
