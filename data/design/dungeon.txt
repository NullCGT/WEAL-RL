- First Layer: Limbo

- Final Layer: Terminus
    - An enormous train station?

DUNGEON DESIGN
- What do we *need* out of this dungeon?
    - Ability to stealth around monsters.
    - High replayability.
    - Tells a story.
    - Multiple ways to approach a given situation.
- Most structures are not similar at a high level. Instead, they are
  similar at a local level.

DUNGEON GENERATION ALGORITHM
- Generate the Dungeon.
- Recurse up the BSP tree:
    - At the room level, populate rooms.
        - A room contains terrain, actors.
            - Terrain features are just actors, but have such a high weight that
              they cannot be picked up without large strength enhancements.
                - This could lead to potentially interesting things, such as high
                  strength players utilizing things like tables as weapons.
                - As an aside, we could make a change such that large, heavy items
                  cost additional movement to enter the space of. That way, you
                  cannot just sprint through a table.
                - As an example: A toilet.
                    - [a]ctivating the toilet flushes it.
                    - Give it an inventory so that it can store items.
        - An example room might be a bathroom.
        - Potentially floor color?
    - At each level beyond the room level, populate with a theme.
        - A theme might be spider-infested, or partially destroyed, or
          flooded, or burning, or filled with gas.
        - Themes don't just have to be terrain. There could be a "high
          security" theme which replaces the type of doors, or a sciency
          theme which generates lab equipment.
        - Because we are recursing up the tree, themes can overlap. This should
        allow us to generate interesting situations, such as "filled with flames
        and flamable gas" or "faulty electronics and flooded."
        - Lock certain themes to certain levels. For example, lower levels should
          generate secret labs, prisons, etc., and should not generate offices
          and meeting rooms.
- Add the set of stairs that the player entered at.
- Add at least one set of stairs down. Ensure that it is at least partway
  across the level.
