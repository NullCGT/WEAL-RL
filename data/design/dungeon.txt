- First Layer: Limbo

    - An enormous train station?

DUNGEON DESIGN
- What do we *need* out of this dungeon?
    - Ability to stealth around monsters.
    - High replayability.
    - Tells a story.
    - Multiple ways to approach a given situation.
- Most structures are not similar at a high level. Instead, they are
  similar at a local level.

DUNGEON GENERATION ALGORITHM
- Step One: Pick a starting place.
    - Biased toward the center of the dungeon.
- Step Two: Generate a room.
    - Each room has several "candidates" which can hold a door.
- Step Three: More rooms.
    - Generate a new room that is contiguous to the old one.
    - Allow rooms to occasionally (infrequently!) overlap.
- Step Four: Connections.
    - Add connections between rooms so that the dungeon is not a perfect
      tree.
- Step Five: Dungeon Features:
    - Carve a river into the dungeon, or a chasm, or something of the sort.
- Step Five: Room Features.
    - Assign each room a type, and fill the room with that kind
      of feature.
    - Room types could be taken from the dungeon definition file.
- Step Six: Population.
    - Populate each room with creatures that are relevant to it.
    - Prefer monsters whose tags match both the room's tags and
      the preferred tags of the dungeon???
