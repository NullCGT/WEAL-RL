    "description": "This humanoid died long ago, yet its limbs still twitch, as if controlled by an unskilled puppeteer. Exposure has beaten its skin into a rubbery mass from which the occasional bone protrudes. The fact that this creature was once human is betrayed only by its eyes, which remain fixed upon the heavens."
