                |= S.I.O.S. USER MANUAL =|

Listen up, Civilian.

Normally, you would receive a textbook and spend weeks
committing this crap to memory, but we don't have that
kind of time. I've done my best to hit the high points
here.

You're our last hope, and this software cost us half
our budget, so don't screw this up.

                |= MOVEMENT =|

Movement: It's what keeps you alive. You can move using the
numpad, arrow keys, or vikeys, as diagrammed below:

789   yku
456   h.l
123   bjn

Moving into a hostile will cause you to automatically attack
them. Remember that.

Holding shift while inputting a direction will cause you to
move in that direction until you encounter an obstacle or
something that requires your attention.

Remember: You can move in all eight cardinal directions, not
just four.

             |= ADVANCED KEYBINDS =|

This section is about advanced keybinds. York tells me that
they're for "power users," but I think that's complete
horse crap.  If you ask me, the only people who learn these
are doing it to show off. Just stick to your basics, and
you'll be fine.

              |= DEBUG KEYBINDS =|

Hey _______. This next section is pretty tricky, so Colonel
Koval tapped me to write it. Sorry about all of this, by the
way.

As a provisional member of _______, you are not authorized
to use any of the following functions. Nonetheless, the Colonel
felt it best for you to be aware of their existence. They
could come in handy if your software is on the fritz.

Best of luck out there. I hope you find Kate.
