This is a README :)

# BUILDING
To build the game for the first time, execute the following commands:

    chmod 777 build.sh
    ./build.sh

FOr subsequent builds, you may simply run make.

    make

When launching build.sh, will be presented with a choice of frontends.
The ncurses version of the game will run directly in your terminal,
while the pdcurses version will launch in an external SDL2 window.

# REQUIREMENTS
* If you are compiling with ncurses, you will need the ncurses library.
* If you are compiling with pdcurses, you will need SDL2 installed.

license. This includes, amonng other things, keeping your fork open source.

If you do fork this game, please let me know! I would love to collaborate with
you, or at the very least play your game and see your ideas.
