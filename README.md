# OVERVIEW

This is a README :)

# BUILDING
To build the game, run build.sh. You will be presented with a choice of
frontends. The ncurses version of the game will run directly in your terminal,
while the pdcurses version will launch an external SDL2 window for playing the
game. The pdcurses version is recommended for Windows users.

* If you are compiling with ncurses, you will need the ncurses library.

* If you are compiling with pdcurses, you will need SDL2 installed.

# FORKING
