# High Severity
- The game will very occasionally segfault on startup.

# Low Severity
- If the map is smaller than the map window and the player moves to the
  far left, odd scrolling behavior will occur. This is not a bug and does
  not impact gameplay, but it does look a bit odd.

# PDCurses
- Color does not work.
- Numpad movement is buggy: A single keystroke results in two consecutive
  inputs.
