# High Severity
- The game will very occasionally segfault on startup.
- The game will segfault if the user attempts to load a nonexistent xml file
  for map generation purposes.

# Low Severity
- If the map is smaller than the map window and the player moves to the
  far left, odd scrolling behavior will occur. This is not a bug and does
  not impact gameplay, but it does look a bit odd.
